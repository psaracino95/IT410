#Create a set of six conditional tests with three evaluating to
#True and three evaluating to False. Work to differentiate your tests,
# testing different variable types, values, and equality tests; no two
# tests should be too similar.
#Before each test, add a comment stating whether or not you expect the
# conditional expression to evaluate to True or False. Then, print the
# result of the expression. 

#I predict that the name True
Name= "Bones"
print(Name=="Bones")

#I predict the code is wrong
Code= 5545
print(Code=="5433")

#I predict the list will be True
Vegetables= ["Beans","Cucumber","Artechoke"]
print("Cucumber" in Vegetables)

#Milestone mark to help evaluate
print("~~~~~~~~~~~~")

#I predict this will be False
